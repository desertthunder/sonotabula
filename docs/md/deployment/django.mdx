# Django Project

To setup and install the dependencies for the app, first we want to generate
a `requirements.txt` file from the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files.
Poetry can do this for us by running the following command:

```bash
poetry export --without-hashes --format=requirements.txt > requirements.txt
```
