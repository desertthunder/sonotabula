# Welcome

Welcome to the Dashspot developer documentation site. It is intended to be a
comprehensive log of my development process and resources for using and
extending the application.

on top of a Django backend serving a single-page React application.

## Core Features

1. **Spotify Library Integration**

2. **Music Analysis**

3. **Music Metadata**

## Requests

Feel free to submit an issue on Github [here](https://github.com/desertthunder/spotify-dashboard/issues)
for any bugs or feature requests you may have.
