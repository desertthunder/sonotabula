## Playback API

Playback endpoints are all synchronous.

## Library API

Library endpoints can occur either synchronously or asynchronously.
    - **Asynchronous endpoints** return the newest data from the API (but still update the
    record in the database).
    - **Synchronous Endpoints** return whatever is in the database.
    - This is based on the `sync` param.
These endpoints also *only* return lists.

### Endpoints

1. [Playlists](./playlists.md)
The asynchronouse playlist endpoint is visible on the home page of the dashboard.
For synchronous, it is visible on the playlist page.
